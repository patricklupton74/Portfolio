      <article>
        <h3>PDF Merger Web Application</h3>
        <p>ASP.NET, C#, HTML, JavaScript, CSS</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Engineered a full-stack web application to merge multiple PDF documents using C# and Minimal APIs, handling complex file streams with asynchronous I/O.</li>
          <li>Implemented robust server-side validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and prevent non-PDF uploads.</li>
          <li>Optimised user experience by integrating SortableJS for drag-and-drop file reordering, ensuring the frontend state synced with backend processing.</li>
          <li>Architected a stateless, in-memory processing pipeline, trading persistent storage for improved user privacy, memory efficiency, and simpler operational complexity, with immediate resource deallocation via IDisposable memory streams.</li>
        </ul>
